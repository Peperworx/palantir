# Palantir

Palantir is a Work In Progress P2P networking library written in Rust. 

At the time of viewing, there may not be any code published yet. I commonly keep Work-In-Progress libraries private until they are ready for release, however for this one I want to get to an MVP as fast as possible. While this is currently published with no code at version 0.0.0, there will be many sudden very breaking changes. For this purpose, until version 1.0.0 is released, every minor version can be considered to contain breaking changes. This is the same for other projects including [Fluxion](https://github.com/peperworx/fluxion), and a library to integrate this one with Fluxion (that is still in progress).
